Yari has served on two professional boards, helping create programming that raised over $150K and doubled board membership. She's poured into the next generation as a mentor to a 20-woman undergraduate sorority chapter, guiding them through fundraising, recruitment and operations. In her corporate role she leads DEI programming, lifting voices and making sure people feel connected, seen and valued.</p>
              <p class="mt-4">As the oldest daughter of immigrants and a first-generation college grad, Yari knows what it means to step into spaces no one before her did. She's committed to strengthening nuestra comunidad, elevating Latina voices and helping LSP grow as a safe powerful space for everyone who walks in.</p>
              <p class="mt-4">As President, Yari wants to continue expanding access to wellness, deepen community connection and grow opportunities for members to lead, create and shine. Her vision is to make LSP a place where everyone, especially every mujer, feels supported in their healing journey from their first class to their biggest milestone. She hopes to elevate programming, strengthen partnerships, amplify Latina voices and create more spaces where women can show up as their full selves.</p>`,

        bio: `<p>Hola, I'm Yesi! I work as an underwriting assistant at a company that helps 501(c)(3) non-profits, governmental, and tribal entities manage their unemployment costs, allowing them to save money and use that money to help fulfill and expand their missions, which I find intrinsically rewarding.</p>
              <p class="mt-4">I'm also a loving mom of an 8 year old boy and a future yoga teacher at the Latina Sweat Project. I am excited to share the gift of yoga to our communities and help guide others on their yoga journeys soon.</p> 
              <p class="mt-4">In my free time, I love to go on runs or nature walks with my two beloved dogs, Kobyto and Peaches, cuddle and take cozy naps with my cat Benito, or capture precious fleeting moments through my camera lens.</p>`,

        bio: `<p>Noe Villagomez, Jr. is an operations and community-focused leader with more than twenty years of experience supporting equity-driven programs across Chicago. A bilingual (Spanish/English) immigrant professional, he has dedicated his career to building safe, accessible spaces and expanding resources for communities historically underserved.</p>
              <p class="mt-4">As Manager for the Chicago Transit Authority, Noe oversees complex operations, safety and compliance programs, and teams. His leadership centers on workforce development, equitable training, and building pathways for community members—values deeply connected to the mission of the Latina Sweat Project.</p>
              <p class="mt-4">Previously, Noe served nearly 17 years at the Auditorium Theatre, a Chicago RE non-profit, ultimately as Director of House Operations & Guest Experience, where he led accessibility initiatives, community partnerships, and large-scale public events. He worked closely with internal and external clients, city agencies, and neighborhood organizations to ensure cultural programming remained safe and welcoming for families, students, and residents across Chicago's most impacted communities.</p>
              <p class="mt-4">Noe's career reflects the same priorities that drive the Latina Sweat Project—wellness, community care, representation, and access. His experience building and training diverse teams, and strengthening public-serving operations positions him to support Latina Sweat as it expands wellness programs, mutual aid efforts, and its pipeline of new BIPOC instructors.</p>
              <p class="mt-4">Rooted in service, equity, and community empowerment, Noe Villagomez, Jr. is committed to helping the Latina Sweat Project continue growing its impact across the Southwest Side and beyond.</p>`,

              <p class="mt-4">My name is Alejandra Garcia and I am a south-sider from Chicago with big dreams. All my life I have known I wanted to be a leader and create a positive impact on my community. From being an educator I have learned that these dreams and goals are always bigger than myself. I want to continue to be a representation to little humans and other Latinas that no matter how big or small your dream is... anything is possible. As a secretary I am confident I can meet all the expected requirements and ensure the community continues to prosper.</p>
