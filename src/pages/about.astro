            Founded in 2022, Latina Sweat began as small pop-up yoga classes in
            Little Village and mutual aid sessions inside migrant shelters. What
            started as an effort to normalize yoga in underserved neighborhoods
            quickly evolved into a movement that combines wellness with
            community care.
