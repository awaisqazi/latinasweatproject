          <p class="mt-6 font-body text-lg text-medium-gray">
            The Latina Sweat Project was born from a desire to create a fitness community that truly understands and celebrates the unique experiences of Latinas and women of color in Chicago.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4 font-body text-lg text-medium-gray">
            Our journey began with a simple idea: to provide a safe and welcoming space where women can come together, support each other, and achieve their fitness goals while embracing their cultural heritage. We've grown into a vibrant community of strong, resilient women who inspire and uplift one another every day.
